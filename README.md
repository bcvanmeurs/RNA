River Network Analysis using Muskingum routing
Welcome to the source code repository for my master thesis.
In this thesis I have used Muskingum routing principles and applied them to a network structure.

The documentation can be found at https://rna.readthedocs.io/.

When published a link to the latest thesis version will also be put here.
