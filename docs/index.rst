River Network Analysis
======================

Welcome to the documentation of the code belonging to my master thesis.
In this thesis I have used Muskingum routing principles and applied them to a network structure.
Documenting is a ongoing process and will emphasize on the developed scripts.


Literature and principles
-------------------------
There is plenty of literature available on Muskingum routing.
Here is a short list:

* For a comprehensive overview of flood routing and other hydrology concepts the
  `National Engineering Handbook Hydrology <https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/national/water/manage/hydrology/?cid=stelprdb1043063>`_ gives a good overview.
  `Chapter 17 <https://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/OpenNonWebContent.aspx?content=35555.wba>`_, section channel flood routing methods explains the Muskingum methods.
* `For the full derivation of the muskingum equation see Todini 2007 <https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1645/2007/hess-11-1645-2007.pdf>`_
* `This is a very clear and practical example by University of Colorado Boulder <http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~ramirez/ce_old/classes/cive322-Ramirez/CE322_Web/Example_MuskingumRouting.htm>`_

This documentation is divided into three sections.
